# Falling Sand Simulator

Basically a 1:1 port of the excellent [Jason McGhee's Falling Sand tutorial](https://jason.today/falling-sand) for the [Playdate](https://play.date/)

Use the crank to move the sand spawn point horizontally and have fun!

## Installation

First you need to install the [crank command line tool](https://github.com/rtsuk/crank) then run

    crank run --release

Or if you have a device attatched

    crank run --release --device
